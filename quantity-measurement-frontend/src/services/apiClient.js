import axios from "axios";

/**
 *
 * * 1. THE BASE SETUP (axios.create):
 * - It sets the 'API_BASE_URL' to your Spring Boot server (running on port 8080).
 * - It creates an 'apiClient' which is a pre-configured "Postman" for your app.
 * Every request sent through this will automatically target your backend.
 * * * 2. REQUEST INTERCEPTOR (The "Automatic Passport Stamper"):
 * - Before any request leaves your computer, this function "intercepts" it.
 * - Logic: It checks your browser's 'localStorage' for a "token".
 * - Action: If it finds a token, it adds it to the Header as 'Bearer [Token]'.
 * This is how your Spring Boot backend knows you are a logged-in user.
 * * * 3. RESPONSE INTERCEPTOR (The "Security Guard"):
 * - When the server sends an answer back, this function checks it first.
 * - The 401 Check: If the server says "401 Unauthorized" (meaning your login
 * session expired), this code automatically wipes your token and "kicks"
 * you back to the Login page.
 * - This prevents users from staying on a page when they are no longer logged in.
 * * * 4. ERROR PROPAGATION:
 * - If the error isn't a 401 (e.g., a 400 Bad Request or 500 Server Error), it
 * simply passes the error along so your 'useAuth' or 'useConversion' hooks
 * can show a specific message to the user.
 *
 *
 *
 * The Flow Summary
 *
 * Request: You try to calculate a measurement -> Axios grabs the request -> Attaches your JWT Token -> Sends it to Spring Boot.
 *                         |
 *                         V
 * Response: Spring Boot checks the token -> Does the math -> Sends a result back.
 *                         |
 *                         V
 * Check: Axios receives the result -> Checks if it's a "Success" or "Unauthorized" -> Hands the data to your component.
 *
